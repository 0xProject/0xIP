## Summary ( 2-5 Sentences )
"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the issue.

## Type: 
Select on of the following [CORE | NON-CORE | PARAMETERS | OPERATIONS]

## Motivation
The motivation is critical to change the 0x protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate with respect to the issue raised. It is acceptable to state an issue without offering suggestions if the issue is cleary defined. 

## Specification
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of the issue. Be it an improvement in computational efficiency or security, try to provide concrete evidence and easily testable cases. If a suggestion is proposed, provide sufficient details so that an implementation would be possible (Proof of Concepts are acceptable). 

## Rationale (if a suggestion is proposed)
The rationale should flesh out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made.

## Implementation

This section must be updated before any Core/Non-Core ZEIP is brought to an executive vote, with a summary of the latest implementation, and by tagging the Issue to the relevant PRs. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.

## Designated team: UFG

This field can be left as UFG (up for grabs) in its initial discussion phase. In order for the ZEIP to be brought to vote (poll and/or executive vote), it needs to have a designated team who have agreed to work on the implementation.


## Sponsor (for CORE type only): UFG

This is relevant only for ZEIPs of type CORE. This field can be left as UFG (up for grabs) in its initial discussion phase. In order for the ZEIP to be brought to vote (poll and/or executive vote), it needs to have a designated team who have agreed to schedule and sponsor the audit.

## Notes
