## Simple Summary (2 Sentences)

Allow smart contracts to generate orders to be used in 0x protocol.

## Abstract

In the current version of 0x protocol, Ethereum accounts can both generate and fill orders. Smart contracts are not capable of generating 0x orders as they do not possess a private key with which to produce an ECDSA signature; however, smart contracts _are_ capable of filling 0x orders that are passed to them as args. This limitation prevents Ethereum smart contracts that hold a balance of ERC20 tokens from generating liquidity via 0x protocol.

## Motivation

Melonport is a platform for creating and operating investment funds. Limited partners (LPs) invest their
Ethereum-based assets with a fund manager (GP) who may then invest LP funds in a set of ERC20 tokens. To prevent the GP from simply stealing LP funds, they are stored within an Ethereum smart contract that places a set of constraints on how the GP moves the assets. As a result, the GP is unable to generate an order to trade LP funds via 0x protocol but they are capable of filling 0x orders generated by others.

## Specification

Allow the owner of a smart contract to generate 0x orders on behalf of the smart contract.
